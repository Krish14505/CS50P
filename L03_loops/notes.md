# Loops in Python:

- To do some actions again and again. 
- It solves the problem of doing the things repetative by using different types of loops. The main goal of all loops is the same, however, the only difference is the syntax how they are written in the code.
- While loop, for loop
- Note: Unfortunately, Python does not have a do-while loop.

Flow chart: 

- Rectangle is used to present any assignment of a variable or print statements.
- Diamond is used to present the condition. 
- Rectangle with curve in the corner represents starting & ending point of the term.

## break and continue keyword in loop:
break keyword: it immediately stops the loop for the current and all the next iterations.
continue keyword: It only stops the iteration for the current one. For the next iteration, it works the same according to the logic.
